# SLO Goals

High-level overview of project goals.

The _main_ goal is to be able to develop a functional language that I can write actual programs with (and complete code challenges like **Advent of Code**, etc).
This is primarily a learning/hobby project for me with no serious intention of competing with or replacing any real-world languages.

A lot of the additional features and syntax is being inspired by `python`.

## Implementation goals

This is a list of some additional features and functionality I would like to change/add. They're not listed in
any particular order and are subject to change.

- everything as an object รก la Python
- expand standard library
- list/dict comprehensions
- user defined imports/libraries
- user defined natives/C libraries
- networking
- threading
- op code caching
- general optimisation / performance improvements
- ~~syntax highlighing~~ and _eventually_ a language server ([basic extension here](https://github.com/ESloman/slo-vscode))

I would like to eventually add type hints or some kind of type system but that's very much a stretch goal.
