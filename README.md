# cslo
C implemention of Slo


Some goals of things to add/change:
- complete all (most) of the challenges in the book
- statically typed
- lists + dictionaries
- `for x in z` for loop type
- different number types: `int`, `float`, `long`
- `print` as a function
- everything as an object รก la Python
- better error reporting (line numbers, reverse stack printing, perhaps even show bad code)
- mixed string/type printing
    - generally string formatting
- standard library ideas:
    - math
    - json
    - io
