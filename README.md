# cslo

C implemention of Slo.

Some goals of things to add/change:

- caching files by writing compiled bytecode to a file
- complete all (most) of the challenges in the book
- statically typed
- lists + dictionaries
- `for x in z` for loop type
- different number types: `int`, `float`, `long`
- `print` as a function
- everything as an object รก la Python
- better error reporting (line numbers, reverse stack printing, perhaps even show bad code)
- mixed string/type printing
  - generally string formatting
- standard library ideas:
  - math
  - json
  - io
  - some kind of http library
